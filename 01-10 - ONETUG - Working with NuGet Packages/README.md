# Working with NuGet Packages Meetup Presentation
This presentation is for the Orlando .NET User Group (ONETUG) meetup held on January 10th, 2019. https://www.meetup.com/ONETUG/events/256542757/

## Abstract:
NuGet has been the de-facto package management solution for .NET since 2010. It's very easy to consume a package in your software and start using it. But what about creating one? Yes, that part's easy too! During this session we will cover the current state of how to work with NuGet packages. Along with how to create them, host them, work with them in a CI/CD environment, and how to allow consumers of your package to debug into the code.
