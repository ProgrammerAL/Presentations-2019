# .NET of Things Presentation
This presentation is for the 2019 Orlando Code Camp meetup held on March 30th, 2019. https://www.orlandocodecamp.com/

## Abstract:
Controlling physical hardware with .NET has been an option for a while now. In this talk, we'll look at a handful of different ways to get started doing that, along with the pros and cons of each, starting with higher-powered devices like a Raspberry Pi, and moving down to lower powered devices more akin to an Arduino, like the GHI Electronics FEZ platform and the newly released Meadow.
